Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Birth of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s)
Structured programming introduced clear, logical structures for writing software. Instead of using unstructured jumps in code (like goto statements), programmers used loops, conditionals, and subroutines. This shift made code easier to understand, debug, and maintain. Key figures like Edsger Dijkstra played a significant role in promoting these concepts.

 The Advent of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s-1990s)
Object-oriented programming (OOP) changed the way software was designed by organizing code into "objects" that represent real-world entities. These objects encapsulate both data and the methods that operate on that data, promoting modularity and reuse. Languages like Smalltalk and C++ were pioneers in OOP, and the approach became mainstream with the popularity of Java.

 The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2000s-Present)
Agile methodologies revolutionized software development by emphasizing iterative progress, collaboration, and flexibility. Unlike traditional, rigid development models, Agile allows teams to adapt to changes and deliver working software frequently. Frameworks like Scrum and Kanban have become integral parts of many development processes, improving productivity and customer satisfaction.




List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of several phases, including:
  - Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall model follows a straight path, where each phase must be completed before the next one begins.Phases include: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance example Construction Industry: Building a large infrastructure project, like a bridge or skyscraper, where requirements must be thoroughly defined and changes are costly.

Agile Methodology:Agile development involves breaking down the project into small, manageable units called iterations or sprints.
phases include: Planning, Design, Development, Testing, Review, Repeat.Example Software Development: Creating a mobile app or web service where user feedback and changing requirements necessitate flexibility and quick adjustments.
